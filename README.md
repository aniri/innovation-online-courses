## About

I looked online for free MOOCs that would offer a strong background for anyone interested in Innovation & Entrepreneurship. The structure is inspired from [MSc Innovation, Entrepreneurship & Management](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/programmes/msc-innovation-entrepreneurship-management/programme-content/core-modules/) from the Imperial College Business School. I will continue to improve the list as I find new courses.

## Preparation

A great MOOC that gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines.

Also I think MOOCs for learning how to use solution-based journalism to impel positive social change would also prove useful :)
