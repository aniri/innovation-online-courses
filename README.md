## About

I looked online for free MOOCs that would offer a strong background for anyone interested in Innovation & Entrepreneurship. The structure is inspired from [MSc Innovation, Entrepreneurship & Management](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/programmes/msc-innovation-entrepreneurship-management/programme-content/core-modules/) from the Imperial College Business School. I will continue to improve the list as I find new courses.

## Preparation

A great MOOC that gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. 

- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) :pizza:

Also I think MOOCs for learning how to use solution-based journalism to impel positive social change would also prove useful :)

- [Journalism for Social Change](https://www.edx.org/course/journalism-social-change-uc-berkeleyx-j4sc101x-0) by University of California, Berkeley - 7 weeks of study, 2 - 4 hours per week
- [Journalism Skills for Engaged Citizens](https://www.coursera.org/learn/journalism-skills) by The University of Melbourne - 6 weeks of study, 4-6 hours/week

Also learning how to research and present an effective and persuasive position paper or policy advice might prove useful.

- [Be Persuasive: Write a Convincing Position Paper or Policy Advice (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/persuasive-writing) by Universiteit Leiden - 4 weeks of study, 2-4 hours of study, 4-5 hours of active project work
